# vim-python-sql (WIP)

This plugin enables SQL syntax highlighting inside single-quoted multiline strings in a Python file. It is heavily based on [Kris Jenkins's vim-python-sql](https://github.com/krisajenkins/vim-java-sql) plugin, from which the rest of this README is copied with little modification:

## Installation

* Install [Pathogen][pathogen]. (You're already using Pathogen, right?)
* Clone this project into `~/.vim/bundle/vim-python-sql`.

## Usage

Whenever you edit a Python file, multiline single-quoted strings (those delimited with `'''...'''`) will be highlighted as SQL.

Matches are case-sensitive, because that's my preference, but it's trivial to
fork & change the matching rules to suit your coding style.

## Notes

This repo serves as a reasonable recipe for embedded Vim syntax highlighting in
general. It could easily be forked for highlighting SQL in Hibernate XML files,
for example.

## Credits

Thanks to [Max Bane][maxbane] who figured out the hard stuff when when [mixing Tex with Python][tex_python_stackoverflow].
